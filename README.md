## hey, i'm nat.

I'm a 3rd year Electrical Engineering and Society student at McMaster University pursuing a minor in business. In the past few years of my post secondary career, I have come to realize what I am truly am passionate about - using one's own voice to be an advocate for what you personally believe in. 
When I first entered engineering I will admit I felt way in over my head, and I still do sometimes. However, amidst all the late night studying, the back-to-back assignments, the endless networking and generally dealing with a great deal of stress at all times, what keeps me going is the thought that one day - if I keep on this path and stay true to my morals - I will be able to be in a position to create real change in this world.
